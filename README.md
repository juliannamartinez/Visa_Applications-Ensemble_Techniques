# Visa_Applications-Ensemble_Techniques
Analysis of the data of Visa applicants

### Project Description:

This dataset contains the data of VISA applicants (employers and employees). This project focuses on using the data to build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approvals, and based on important factors that significantly influence the applicants likelihood of approval. The goal of the predictive model is to make combing through VISA applications faster and more efficient by recommending applicants with specific attributes that are common for visa certifications.

### Skills:

Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost,Gradient Boosting,XGBoost), Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, Exploratory Data Analysis (Variable Identification, Univariate analysis, Bi-Variate analysis), Python

## This project contains 1 file:

Full notebook (Food_delivery_app_project_FULL_NOTEBOOK.ipynb)

> This notebook contains the entirety of the project including all of the code to perform a run-down of the data/datatypes, exploratory data analysis, and all insights and observations. This file contains all variations/tests of classification models with various pruning methods. The final (best) model (image below of feature importances figure) is at the bottom of the notebook with the conclusions and actionable insights.

### Libraries used:

xgboost, sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
